# Website Blocker

A website blocker prevents access to websites permanently or on a schedule. We can block all websites from unwanted categories so that we can use the internet safely.
So, Website Blocker Python project’s goal is to block websites from any device. By blocking websites from the user’s device, this project will help them stay away from distraction as they will not be able to open them.
This project enables the user to enter multiple websites to block, and then clicking on the block button will check whether the website has already been blocked, otherwise, block all those websites and print ‘blocked’.
Remember, when you code this, you can add the sites you need to block by editing sites_to_block, change the host, or edit the time when you need to block the sites.

- For example:
  - Facebook.com
  - Youtube.com
  - Gmail.com
 

## Introduction

A hosts file is part of every operating system. Operating systems may have different locations for the host file. It maps the hostname to the IP address of the machine. Here, we list the websites we want to block.
